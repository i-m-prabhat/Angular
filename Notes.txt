What is Angular?
- Angular is one of the most popular JavaScript framework for building client side applications. It was developed by Google and it's an open source project.
- Angular is a development platform for building a single-page application for mobile and desktop.
- It is used for building client side applications using HTML, CSS and a programming language like JavaScript or TypeScript.
- Angular is not a programming Language in itself like javaScript.

What is a Framework?
- A framework is like a plateform for developing software applications.
- A framework can have pre-defined classes and functions that can be re-used to add several functionalities, which otherwise we would have to write from scrach by our own.
- A framework is a collection of pre-defined classes and methods which provides APIs for performing different operations when used in an application.

What is a SPA?
- A single page application is a web application, which has only one HTML page. When we navigate around, only the content of that HTML page changes. The page itself never changes.

Advantage of SPA
- Since we are using JavaScript to change the content of the page, it is much faster. Here we are not reaching out to the server to request a new piece of HTML data, every time we naviage to a different URL.
- This allows us to create an application which is fast and reactive.

Limitations of JavaScript/JQuery
- Vanilla JavaScript of JQuery code becomes hard to maintain and we will need a way to properly structure our application.
- A lot of applications build using vanilla JavaScript/JQuery is hard to test.
- there are some functionality which we will have to write from scratch when using JavaScript/JQuery

Advantage of using Angular
- Angular gives our application a clean and loosely coupled structure that is easy to understand & maintain.
- It brings a lot of utility code which can be re-used in lot of applications Especially. When dealing with user naviagtion & browser history.
- Applications build with Angular are more testable.

Angular version
- Angular has evolved over the years, with AngularJS being the first version and Angular (version 2 and later) being a complete rewrite using TypeScript.
- AngularJS is rarely used today, and the latest version of Angular is version 17.

Creating a New project 
- Install NODE JS on development machine.
- Install angular CLI globally.
- Create an Angular project.
- Compile & run Angular project.

Angular CLI 
- Angular CLI is a command line interface which we use to create new angular project or generate some boiler plate code as well as create deployable packages.
```
    npm install -global @angular/cli@latest
```

Create Angular Project
- To create a new angular project, move to the folder where you want to create the project using command prompt/terminal and type following command.
```
    ng new project-name
```

Compile & Run Angular Application
- To run Angular project, move to the project folder using command prompt/terminal and type following command.
```
    ng serve
```

Angular Project
- Bootstraping
    -- Bootstraping is the process of initializing or loading the Angular Application
    -- It's done by importing `AppModule` in `main.ts`.
- Angular Cli(ng serve)
    -- Angular CLI saves the compile Angular application in the memory & directly starts it.
    -- If we make any changes to our Angular app, Angular CLI will recompile & update the file.
    -- Angular CLI uses Webpack to traverse through our Angular app & it bundles JS & other files into one or more bundles.
    -- Then Angular CLI also injects the bundled JavaScript & CSS files in the index.html.
- index.html
    -- When the index.html file is loaded, Angular core libraries & third party libraries are also loaded by that time.
    -- Now Angular needs to locate the main entry point.
- angular.json
    -- This file contains all the configurations for your application like source map, optimization level etc.
- main.ts
- AppModule
    -- This class is the root module which contains all other modules.
    -- Imported in main.ts using `import { AppModule } from './app/app.
- AppComponent
    -- The component that represents the entire application.
    -- Injectable service can be used inside this component.
- View Template(app.component.html)
    -- HTML template for the view.


What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is a free & open-source programming language developed by Microsoft.
- Superset of JavaScript with static type checking.

Advantage of TypeScript
- TypeScript is a Superset of javaScript.
- TypeScript has additional features, which do not exist in current version of JavaScript Supported by most browsers.
- TypeScript is strongly typed. But JavaScript is dynamically typed.
- TypeScript has some object-oriented features that we do not have in JavaScript yet.
- With TypeScript, we can catch errors at compile time.

What is a Component?
- A component is a place of user interface.
- Every Angular application has at least one component.
- An Angular application is essentially a tree of component.
- Combining all these Components together makes an Angular UI.
Examples:-
                        App 
-------------------------|----------------------
|           |            |          |          |
Header    Navbar        Main      Footer    Sidebar
                         |                     |
                       Cover                course-1     
                         |                     |     
                       Content              course-1     
                         |                     |     
                       subscribe            course-1     

Create a Component
- Create a TypeScript class & export it.
- Decorate the class with @Component decorator
- declare the class in main module file

Disadvantage of using template properly
- it mixes the HTML & TypeScript code which makes the code less maintainable.
- Since HTML is written as a string. if there is some error, we not know about it during compile time.
- If the number of lines of HTML code is huge, it will be messay & not maintainable.


Disadvantage of using styles properly
- It mixes the CSS & TypeScript code which makes the code less maintainable.
- Since CSS is written as a string, if there is some error, we will not know about it during compile time.
- If the number of lines of CSS code is huge, It will be messay & not maintainable.
