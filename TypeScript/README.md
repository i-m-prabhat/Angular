## TypeScript Notes

### Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to enhance JavaScript development. It was developed by Microsoft and is open-source. TypeScript code is transpiled into regular JavaScript before execution.

### Benefits of TypeScript

- **Static Typing:** TypeScript allows developers to specify types for variables, parameters, and return values, catching type-related errors during development.
- **Code Readability:** Type annotations make the code more self-documenting and easier to understand, especially in larger projects.
- **Early Error Detection:** Static typing enables catching errors at compile time, preventing many runtime issues.
- **Enhanced IDE Support:** TypeScript provides better tooling support in code editors, improving productivity with features like IntelliSense and autocompletion.
- **Modern JavaScript Features:** TypeScript supports the latest ECMAScript standards, ensuring the usage of modern JavaScript features.
- **Code Maintainability:** TypeScript helps manage and maintain larger codebases by providing clear contracts with interfaces and type checking.
- **Gradual Adoption:** TypeScript allows developers to introduce types incrementally, making it suitable for existing JavaScript projects.

### Basic Types in TypeScript

- `number`: For numerical values (e.g., 10, 3.14).
- `string`: For text and character data (e.g., "hello", 'typescript').
- `boolean`: For representing true or false values.
- `any`: A type that allows any value to be assigned (similar to regular JavaScript variables).
- `void`: Represents the absence of any type, commonly used for functions with no return value.
- `null` and `undefined`: Represent the absence of a value.
- `object`: Represents non-primitive types (e.g., arrays, functions, objects).

### Type Annotations

Type annotations are used to specify the type of a variable, function parameter, or return value.
Syntax: `variableName: type` or `function(parameter: type): returnType { ... }`.

### Interfaces

Interfaces define custom data structures with specific properties and their types. They help in defining contracts for objects and classes.
Syntax: `interface InterfaceName { property1: type; property2: type; ... }`.

### Classes in TypeScript

Classes are used to create objects with similar properties and behaviors.
Syntax:

```typescript
class ClassName {
  property: type;
  constructor(parameter: type) {
    this.property = parameter;
  }
  method() {
    // Method logic
  }
}
```

### Type Assertion

Type assertion allows developers to explicitly define the type of a value when the compiler cannot infer it.
Syntax: `value as type` or `<type>value`.

### Enums

Enums allow developers to define a set of named constants, giving more meaning to numeric values.
Syntax:

```typescript
enum EnumName {
  Constant1,
  Constant2,
  // ...
}
```

### Type Guards

Type guards are used to check the type of a value at runtime.
Common type guards include `typeof`, `instanceof`, and custom functions.

### Type Casting

Type casting is another way to convert a variable from one type to another.
Syntax: `<Type>value` or `value as Type`.

### Decorators

Decorators are a TypeScript feature inspired by the decorator pattern. They can be used to modify the behavior of classes, methods, or properties.

### Async/Await

TypeScript supports the modern `async` and `await` syntax for handling asynchronous operations with Promises.

### Triple-Slash Directives

Triple-slash directives are special comments used to provide instructions to the TypeScript compiler.

### Strict Null Checks

TypeScript provides a compiler option (`strictNullChecks`) to enforce strict handling of `null` and `undefined` values.

### Definite Assignment Assertion

TypeScript allows developers to assert that a variable has been initialized before use, even if the compiler cannot verify it.

### TypeScript Compiler Options

TypeScript provides a wide range of compiler options to customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`).

## TypeScript Notes (Continued)

### Type Guards with `in` Keyword

- The `in` keyword is used as a type guard to check if a property exists in an object or is part of a union type.
- Syntax: `property in object`

### Type Guards with `typeof`

- The `typeof` operator can be used as a type guard to check the type of a value at runtime.
- Syntax: `typeof value === "typeName"` (e.g., `typeof value === "string"`)

### Type Guards with `instanceof`

- The `instanceof` operator is another type guard used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class.
- Syntax: `object instanceof ClassName`

### Namespace Imports

- TypeScript supports importing elements from a namespace into the current file to access them more easily.
- Syntax: `import * as NamespaceAlias from "path/to/namespace";`

### Type Narrowing

- TypeScript narrows down the type of a variable within conditional statements based on type guards.
- This helps the compiler infer more specific types.

### Enums with String Values

- Enums can have string values assigned to each constant to create string enums.
- Syntax:

```typescript
enum EnumName {
  Constant1 = "Value1",
  Constant2 = "Value2",
  // ...
}
```

### Mapped Types

- Mapped types allow developers to create new types based on existing ones by applying transformations to properties.
- Syntax:

```typescript
type NewType = {
  [Property in keyof ExistingType]: Transformation;
};
```

### Discriminated Unions

- Discriminated unions combine types using a shared, discriminative property to differentiate between possible values.
- This is a powerful technique to handle complex data structures.

### Type Intersection with `&`

- TypeScript supports combining multiple types into a single type using the `&` (intersection) operator.
- Syntax: `type CombinedType = Type1 & Type2;`

### Type Union with `|`

- Type union allows a variable to hold values that belong to any of the specified types.
- Syntax: `type UnionType = Type1 | Type2;`

### TypeScript Compiler Watch Mode

- TypeScript provides a watch mode (`tsc --watch` or `tsc -w`) to automatically recompile files whenever changes are detected, facilitating a smoother development workflow.

### Type-Only Imports and Exports

- TypeScript supports type-only imports and exports, which are used when you need the type information but not the runtime value.
- Syntax:

```typescript
import type { SomeType } from "path/to/module";
export type { SomeType };
```

### TypeScript and React

- TypeScript is widely used with React to provide static typing and better development experience.

### TypeScript and Redux

- TypeScript is commonly used with Redux to enhance type safety and maintainability in state management.

### TypeScript

 and Express.js

- TypeScript can be used with Express.js to create robust and type-safe server applications.

### TypeScript and GraphQL

- TypeScript is often used with GraphQL to ensure type safety and consistency across the GraphQL schema and the client-side application.

### TypeScript and Webpack

- TypeScript can be integrated with Webpack to enable TypeScript compilation and code optimization for web applications.

### TypeScript and ESLint

- TypeScript is often used in conjunction with ESLint to enforce coding standards and detect common errors.

### TypeScript and Jest

- TypeScript is commonly used with Jest to write type-safe test cases and provide better tooling support for testing.

### TypeScript and Next.js

- TypeScript is commonly used with Next.js to build server-rendered React applications with static typing support.

### TypeScript and Deno

- Deno, a secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime, natively supports TypeScript, making it easy to write and run TypeScript code.

### TypeScript and MongoDB

- TypeScript can be used with MongoDB to create type-safe interactions with the database using libraries like Mongoose.

### TypeScript Mixins with Decorators

- TypeScript decorators can be used to implement mixins, allowing classes to inherit functionality from multiple mixin classes.
